## **Questions for Analysis**

1. We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. Animation,
Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music are considered as family movies

2. Now we need to know the length of rental duration in each movie category of these
family-friendly movies.

3. We want to know the count of movies within each combination of film
category for each corresponding rental duration category.

4. We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental
orders during every month for all the years we have data for.
